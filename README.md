# GitHub Environment Deployments Demo

Demonstrates using GitHub environments to track deployments and a "queueing"
system for dev environment deployments.

The use of GitHub environments enables the use of custom [Environment
Deployment Status UI](https://sethreno.github.io/env-deploy-example/) which
provides an overview of deployments for a configurable list of repos.
